## üìù Development Workflow

### Creating a Branch

1. **Update your main branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull upstream main
   ```

2. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

   Branch naming conventions:
   - `feature/` - New features
   - `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
   - `hotfix/` - Critical production fixes
   - `docs/` - Documentation updates
   - `refactor/` - Code refactoring

### Making Changes

1. **Write clean, readable code**
   - Follow C# coding conventions
   - Add XML documentation comments for public APIs
   - Keep methods focused and single-purpose

2. **Test your changes**
   - Test the functionality manually
   - Ensure existing features still work
   - Check for any console errors

3. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Brief description of your changes"
   ```

   Commit message format:
   - `Add:` - New features
   - `Fix:` - Bug fixes
   - `Update:` - Updates to existing features
   - `Refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `Docs:` - Documentation changes

### Submitting Changes

1. **Push your branch to your fork**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**
   - Go to the ProTrack repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"

## üé® Code Style Guidelines

### C# Coding Conventions

- Use PascalCase for public properties and methods
- Use camelCase for private fields and local variables
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Keep methods under 50 lines when possible
- Add XML documentation for public APIs

### Example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Retrieves all active clients for the current user
/// </summary>
/// <returns>List of active clients</returns>
public async Task<List<Client>> GetActiveClientsAsync()
{
    var userId = _userManager.GetUserId(User);
    return await _context.Clients
        .Where(c => c.UserId == userId && c.IsActive)
        .OrderBy(c => c.Name)
        .ToListAsync();
}
```

### Razor Views

- Use consistent indentation (4 spaces)
- Keep views focused and avoid complex logic
- Use partial views for reusable components
- Add comments for complex sections

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test the new feature with various inputs
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios
- [ ] Verify the UI is responsive
- [ ] Check browser console for errors
- [ ] Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- [ ] Verify database changes are correct

## üìö Documentation

### Code Documentation

- Add XML comments to all public methods
- Document complex algorithms or business logic
- Update README.md if adding new features
- Update database schema documentation if changing models

### Example

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Calculates the total billable hours for a project
/// </summary>
/// <param name="projectId">The ID of the project</param>
/// <returns>Total billable hours as a decimal</returns>
public async Task<decimal> CalculateBillableHoursAsync(int projectId)
{
    // Implementation
}
```
